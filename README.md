# something for you

![For You](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a1m01q7jjxz7sfh/foryou.png?raw=1=250x250)

### Purpose :bow:

The purpose of this assignment is to create a web application that utilizes HTML, CSS and Javascript, and designing a website to give to someone or a community in Hong Kong.

### Description :runner:

Think of a project that you could work on for the next ten days, and something you could build for someone (or a group of people). We will make time to present this presentation in two weeks (April 7).

Details are important; people end up not being careful because they have the belief that things can be completed quickly. The task of a developer, really, is to ensure that we plan out well, and give details the prestige they deserve. The better fix is to get a more accurate vision of things - good things take time to build - you don’t need to aim for perfection. Aim for ‘good enough’.
\*The purpose of this website is also for you to utilize the technologies that we go through in class, so it would be great if you could implement one thing you learned everyday and add that to your website (the most important thing is that you code the application yourself).

Requirements:
Users will be able to understand your purpose or mission.
Users will be able to see different kinds of media on your website.
Users will be able to see some kind of animation on your screen (animate.css, wow.js or jQuery are great options).
Users will be able to see data rendered from elsewhere (please make an API call - we’ll go through this on day 11).
Users will be able view your application on their mobile application (ensure that the website is mobile responsive).

Some potential ideas:
Sell an idea
E.g., The importance of gaming to destress
Informational Websites:
Camping Sites in Hong Kong
Diving Areas

# Documentation

When creating projects and web-pages it is a good idea to document how another developer can use your application. Documentation online, shows users how they should be using their libraries and the use-cases for their code.

So let us explore how we should document our projects so that other people can use them.

## Specification file (spec file)

Inside a Spec file develops will write the specifications for their application. But what does that actually mean!?!

Specifications are the functionalities of your website or application.

ETC....

In the example above, we are essentially just listing out what functions our application will have, you can also decide if you have a landing page if you want but this usually goes into the wireFrame

## WireFrame

Developers use a wireframe so that they can get their page concepts straight and aligned with one another. So it essentially will document the flow of your application. This flow will detail all the elements on each of your pages, your navbar, buttons, content and where it should be even the images (placeholders).

If you've buttons and they link to new pages then you should use an arrow to show the new page that is sent when the button is pressed.

For this project, you will have a basic representation of the index.html, in your wireFrame, specify which buttons will do what and how your page will be styled.

## Powerpoint Presentations

Throughout this course you will be working in groups to create projects that you will present to the class. During these presentations you will need to address a couple of key things,

    Why you built this project - does it solve real world problems

    The project outlook and appearance - shown through the wireframe (a screen cap or two will suffice)

    What technology did you use to build the application - the stack you used for your frontend and backend..
    For the canvas application, bootstrap, jquery, fontawesome hammerJS ETC.

## Readme.md

In a Readme.md one would usually detail, how to get the application to work:

### Example Documentation commands

EG:

Clone the github repository to your local machine.

### Example library

With this in mind, in the Readme, you should also list any external libraries you use, both for frontend code (like CDNS) and backend code (like npm packages), and why you have used them in your project

EG (1) - ALOT of detail

In this Personal Page, I have used Bootstrap, so that I can easily manipulate content in a structured manner (using the col system) moreover, bootstrap will automatically resize the images when they have the class 'img-fluid' this is very useful so that I do not need to use many @media queries.

EG (2) - BareBones

In my HTML document I used:

            BootStrap - for styling

            JQuery - for easy selection

            FontAwesome - so I could use their free icons

            SmoothScroll - so that the page scrolls in a smooth manner and doesnt just snap from section to section

            Animate.Css - So that we can animate elements without custom animations.

### Example fixes

You should also include how you overcame the many bugs that you encountered when coding your application.

EG:

During the creation of this website, I wanted to use a navigation bar that was fixed to the left side of our page, however, I couldnt find the documentation to do it. So I manipulated the CSS and realised that if I changed right:0 to left:0 in my css, the element moves!!
