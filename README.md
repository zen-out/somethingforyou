### Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to create a web application that utilizes HTML, CSS and Javascript, and designing a website to give to someone or a community in Hong Kong.

### How to run

1. cd in this folder
2. Run the following commands

```
npm install
```

```
json-server --watch db.json
```

3. Open home.html

### Description :runner:

Think of a project that you could work on for the next ten days, and something you could build for someone (or a group of people). We will make time to present this presentation in two weeks (April 7).

Details are important; people end up not being careful because they have the belief that things can be completed quickly. The task of a developer, really, is to ensure that we plan out well, and give details the prestige they deserve. The better fix is to get a more accurate vision of things - good things take time to build - you don’t need to aim for perfection. Aim for ‘good enough’.

#### important sidenote

The purpose of this website is also for you to utilize the technologies that we go through in class, so it would be great if you could implement one thing you learned everyday and add that to your website (the most important thing is that you code the application yourself).

### Requirements

- Users will be able to understand your purpose or mission.
- Users will be able to see different kinds of media on your website.
- Users will be able to see some kind of animation on your screen (animate.css, wow.js or jQuery are great options).
- Users will be able to see data rendered from elsewhere (please make an API call - we’ll go through this on day 11)
- Users will be able view your application on their mobile application (ensure that the website is mobile responsive).

Some potential ideas:
Sell an idea
E.g., The importance of gaming to destress
Informational Websites:
Camping Sites in Hong Kong
Diving Areas

## WireFrame

Developers use a wireframe so that they can get their page concepts straight and aligned with one another. So it essentially will document the flow of your application. This flow will detail all the elements on each of your pages, your navbar, buttons, content and where it should be even the images (placeholders).

If you've buttons and they link to new pages then you should use an arrow to show the new page that is sent when the button is pressed.

For this project, you will have a basic representation of the index.html, in your wireFrame, specify which buttons will do what and how your page will be styled.

## Readme.md

In a Readme.md one would usually detail, how to get the application to w

### Example library

With this in mind, in the Readme, you should also list any external libraries you use, both for frontend code (like CDNS) and backend code (like npm packages), and why you have used them in your project

EG (1) - ALOT of detail

In this Personal Page, I have used Bootstrap, so that I can easily manipulate content in a structured manner (using the col system) moreover, bootstrap will automatically resize the images when they have the class 'img-fluid' this is very useful so that I do not need to use many @media queries.

EG (2) - BareBones

In my HTML document I used:

            BootStrap - for styling

            JQuery - for easy selection

            FontAwesome - so I could use their free icons

            SmoothScroll - so that the page scrolls in a smooth manner and doesnt just snap from section to section

            Animate.Css - So that we can animate elements without custom animations.

### Example fixes

You should also include how you overcame the many bugs that you encountered when coding your application.
