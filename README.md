# something for you

Think of a project that you could work on for the next ten days, and something you could build for someone (or a group of people). We will make time to present this presentation in two weeks (April 7).

Details are important; people end up not being careful because they have the belief that things can be completed quickly. The task of a developer, really, is to ensure that we plan out well, and give details the prestige they deserve. The better fix is to get a more accurate vision of things - good things take time to build - you don’t need to aim for perfection. Aim for ‘good enough’.
